            We can say without a semblance of doubt that she was a woman who had an<br>
            interesting life. She was courious, intelligent and talented. She travelled and<br>
            changed residence many times from a young age. She was the first to do<br>
            many things on the big screen when films were still made in black and white:<br>
            she was a star. But she also had a great and resourceful mind, that made her<br>
            learn from everything available around her; she did experiments and made<br>
            inventions. One of which is very present in our daily life nowadays. <br><br>
            Some facts about her:<br>
        <p2>
